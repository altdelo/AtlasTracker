# AtlasTracker
###### Name in progress
Tool to handle project logging easier. I always forget to logg my progress during the day and remeber it at the end. 
At that time i have forgotten everything and find it a hard time to logg accurately and this is why i have created a Tool to make this all easier!

Atlas tracker uses something called TimeCards that stores when you started the task, when you finished the task, 
the duration of the task and with a description to hold notes on what spefically was done durint the TimeCard. 

There is three TimeCard types:
- Meeting
- Break
- Task

Meeting and Task TimeCards are pretty much the same with different category name to keep the separete.
Break TimeCard dosent store any discrption and wont ask you for any notes.

## How to Download
Donwload zip folder. In the folder there will be this readme text and a folder eith an EXE file. 
You can put the exe file where ever you want on your pc. Where the exe is placed is the same place all timeCard data will be stored in a txt file
